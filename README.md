Virtual Pet

This Virtual Pet project allows users to create their own companion, where they can share a space together beyond physical limitations!

Your pet will have the following features:

• You can name them

• They can age

• As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit, so be sure to feed them and take them on walks!

• You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness

• You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger

• You can check up on your pet to see if it needs feeding, walking, or if it feels just fine :)

• If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will die :(

• If your pet gets too old (30 days old) it will die :(

• You can adopt a child!
